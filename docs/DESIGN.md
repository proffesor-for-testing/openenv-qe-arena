# openenv-qe-arena design

A training environment for [OpenEnv Arena](https://openenvarena-arena.hf.space/). The arena trains
Qwen3.8-27B with GRPO in this environment and then scores it on 40 private tasks in 8 domains.
This environment targets the software-engineering domain with quality-engineering skills:
finding and fixing a bug, and reasoning precisely about what code does.

## Constraints that shape everything

- **Arena sandbox:** 2 vCPU, 16 GiB, no GPU, and it has **outbound internet**, so keeping candidate code offline
  is our job (the static gate below). The image must be under 2 GiB compressed with one port and a `/health`
  endpoint. OpenEnv is pinned to `86a180ede21e044f7929b9a7783ad83aa67d83a3`. Rewards are in `[0, 1]`.
- **The trainer builds its system prompt from our action schema.** Field descriptions are the only text we
  control there, so they state the protocol. Each optimizer step plays 5 episodes of one task in fresh sandboxes.
  No seed is guaranteed at reset, so an unseeded reset draws a fresh instance from OS randomness. A fixed
  instance per task ID would let the model memorise it (one entrant's run saturated to zero reward variance that way).
- **An invalid reply ends the episode** and is scored through `finish_action` (`{"op": "submit", "answer": {}}`).
  For `qe_bugfix` that grades the edits made so far, so real work still counts. The unchanged file scores 0.
- **The trainer appears to run with thinking off** (inferred by rUv's team from completion lengths). With
  thinking off, Qwen3.8 echoes the action schema unless the reset prompt states the reply format with a
  concrete example. Every reset prompt here does.
- **Budgets are per episode** and count every observation after reset, so observations stay small:
  functions are 12–45 lines and test output is truncated.
- **GRPO needs mixed outcomes.** A cell the model always solves or never solves gives no gradient. We
  calibrate each family × difficulty to 1–3 successes out of 4 in thinking-off mode.
- **No free reward.** Submitting the unchanged buggy code, an empty answer or a malformed action earns 0.

## Task families

Native task IDs follow `<family>-d<1|2|3>`, for example `qe_bugfix-d2`.

### `qe_bugfix`: repair an injected bug

A corpus function gets 1, 2 or 3 injected faults (by level). The model sees the buggy module, a short spec and
visible tests. It can read files, run the visible tests, edit with an exact string replacement, and submit.

| Level | What the model gets |
|---|---|
| d1 | One fault. An input that the bug breaks, without its expected value (derive it from the docstring). Visible tests pass |
| d2 | Two faults, at least one subtle (at most 15% of hidden inputs reveal it). No failing input |
| d3 | Three faults, at least two subtle. No failing input |

Calibration v1 (thinking off, 8 episodes per cell) showed that giving the expected value of a failing test made
the task trivial (d1 and the old d3 both 8/8), so no level shows an expected value for a failing input. Calibration v2 (12 episodes per cell) still
solved single-fault d2 12/12, so d2 and d3 now carry 2 and 3 faults. The prompt never states how many there
are, so the model has to keep checking the code against the spec instead of stopping after the first fix.

Reward: **1.0 only if every hidden differential test passes** (edge cases plus seeded random inputs,
compared against the original function's outputs). Otherwise 0. Unchanged code is 0. Partial credit is
deliberately absent: a mutant already passes most inputs, so a pass fraction would pay for doing nothing.

### `qe_mutant_kill`: write a test that kills a mutant

The model sees the original function and a mutant as a unified diff. It submits a test case as data:
`{"args": [...], "expected": <value>}`. No model-written code ever runs.

| Level | What the model gets |
|---|---|
| d1 | One mutant that random inputs kill often |
| d2 | One mutant that random inputs rarely kill (the input must be chosen deliberately) |
| d3 | Three subtle mutants (each revealed by at most 15% of random inputs). Up to three test cases; credit is the mean over mutants |

Reward per mutant (best over the submitted tests): 0.5 if `original(args) != mutant(args)` (the input
distinguishes them), and 1.0 if it also has `expected == original(args)` exactly (the model computed the
right answer by hand). A correct `expected` on an input that does not kill earns nothing, so easy inputs
give no free credit. A kill with a wrong `expected` still earns half, which keeps a learning gradient for
partly right reasoning. The episode reward is the mean over mutants.

## Action protocol (one schema for both families)

```json
{"op": "read", "path": "*"}
{"op": "run_tests"}
{"op": "edit", "path": "module.py", "old": "if n < lo:", "new": "if n <= lo:"}
{"op": "submit", "answer": {}}
{"op": "submit", "answer": {"tests": [{"args": [3, 7], "expected": 10}]}}
```

- `read`: one virtual file, or `*` for all files in one observation.
- `run_tests`: `qe_bugfix` only. Runs the visible tests on the current working copy. At most 3 calls.
- `edit`: `qe_bugfix` only. `old` must occur exactly once in the file. Edits accumulate.
- `submit`: ends the episode. `qe_bugfix` grades the working copy; `qe_mutant_kill` grades `answer.tests`.

At most 12 steps per episode.

## Verifier integrity

The oracle never runs in the same process as model-influenced code.

1. **Reference outputs** come from running the original corpus function in the sandbox. Calls are JSON
   in, JSON out.
2. **Candidate code** (a `qe_bugfix` working copy) runs in a separate child process (`python -S -s -P` with
   `PYTHONHASHSEED=0`; `-I` is not used because it ignores the hash seed, and set ordering would then differ
   between the reference and the candidate):
   - an environment set entirely by the parent, and a temporary working directory;
   - rlimits on CPU, address space, file size (0), open files and core dumps, set by the child on itself
     before any candidate code is compiled. There is no process-count limit, because RLIMIT_NPROC is
     per-user; the static gate makes forking unreachable;
   - stdout and stderr redirected away, and results returned on a private channel tagged with a nonce;
   - per-call and per-batch wall-clock timeouts.
   The child returns only the outputs for the given inputs. Expected values never enter the child.
3. **A static gate runs before execution.** It rejects imports outside an allowlist (`math`, `re`,
   `itertools`, `functools`, `collections`, `string`, `bisect`, `heapq`, `statistics`, `decimal`,
   `fractions`). It also rejects dunder attribute access and the names `open`, `exec`, `eval`, `compile`,
   `__import__`, `globals`, `locals`, `vars`, `getattr`, `setattr`, `delattr`, `breakpoint`, `input`, `help`
   and `memoryview`. Code runs with a restricted builtins map. This stops the obvious hack: reading the
   reference implementation from the image.
4. **Results are compared in the parent.** Values must be JSON-equal with strict types (bool is not int,
   int is not float). Floats match to `1e-9` relative or `1e-12` absolute. An exception compares by type
   name, so a function that is specified to raise `ValueError` must keep raising it. In `qe_mutant_kill`, an
   int `expected` is read as a float wherever the original returned a float, at any depth, because JSON
   writes `2.0` as `2`. Whether `{"raises": ...}` means an exception depends on what the original actually
   did.
5. **Machine load never decides an outcome.** A timed-out call is re-probed alone with a 400x margin over
   the corpus's 5 ms budget. Only code that still times out is treated as looping; otherwise the batch is
   rerun with generous limits. A timeout or crash is never a behavioural difference: it is never a fault,
   never a kill, and never makes generation fall through to another function.
6. **No partial credit by accident.** Every non-empty proper subset of a task's faults must still fail some
   hidden input, so faults that cancel each other out can never let a partial fix pass. A d1 fault must be
   revealed by at least 3 distinct hidden calls, so special-casing the one reported call cannot pass.
7. **What the model sees is by design.** Visible tests and the d1 report are drawn from the hidden pool
   (they pass, or are named without their expected value). In mutant-kill, the original plus the diff is
   the mutant. Values echoed by `run_tests` are capped at 200 characters each.

Items 4 to 7 came from independent review of the grader: an adversarial Codex review, a red team that built
exploits, and mutation testing of the verifier (305 mutants; the first suite caught 72.1%, the hardened
suite 97.5%). Each confirmed finding has a regression test in `tests/test_review_findings.py` or
`tests/test_reward_integrity.py`.

## Corpus contract

Each corpus entry is one file `qe_arena/corpus/<name>.py`:

```python
"""One-line summary. Adapted from <owner/repo>@<sha>:<path> (MIT)."""   # or "Original." when not adapted
META = {"entry": "function_name", "origin": "...", "tags": ["parsing"]}

def function_name(a, b):
    """Precise spec, including edge cases and what raises."""
    ...

def gen_inputs(rng, n):
    """Return exactly n argument lists. Deterministic edge cases first, then rng-driven cases."""
```

Rules:
- Standard library only, and only modules from the static-gate allowlist.
- Pure and deterministic: no I/O, no time, no global state.
- Total over `gen_inputs` within 5 ms per call.
- Arguments and return values are JSON-serializable: int, str, bool, None, lists, and dicts with
  string keys. Avoid floats unless they are essential.
- The entry function plus helpers is 12–45 lines.
- At least 6 mutation sites, with at least 80% of single mutants killed by `gen_inputs(rng, 64)`.

## Calibration and submission

- `scripts/calibrate.py` drives the environment in-process with the arena-style system prompt. It calls
  `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B` through the HF router with `enable_thinking: false` and records each episode's
  trajectory, usage and reward.
- The submission request is rendered and checked with the same discipline as rUv's MetaHarness entry:
  exact image digest, anonymous pull, `openenv validate`, `/schema` equality, and native replay of
  every task ID.
